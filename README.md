#### The idea of the project is to provide students a common platform, where they can explore various career oppurtunities.<br/>
Today many students are confused to choose their career option. Also many people try to change their field after graduation or after a very long time. Some students dropout from the college to explore their own interest or to get trained in their passionate field. In India this is a very common problem. Sometimes, the change might cost a lot of money or a lot of time(which can be a decade as well). This happens due to lack of knowledge, resources or guidance.  
<br/>

Here, we have designed a simple prototype, which depicts, all the resources can be brought together on a single platform, and students can explore all the available career oppurtunities and take experts guidance.
